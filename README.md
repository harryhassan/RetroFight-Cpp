## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [SFML Library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)
- C++17 compatible compiler
- Visual Studio or any IDE of your choice

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hassanharry/RetroRumble-Cpp.git
Set up SFML:

Link the necessary SFML static libraries (graphics, window, system)

Build and run the project.

🎮 Controls
Key	Action
W	Jump
A / D	Move Left/Right
J	Punch
K	Kick
SPACE	Special Action (if implemented)

🤖 Enemy AI
The enemy character performs randomized actions (move, attack, idle) based on distance from the player and internal cooldowns, providing an unpredictable and dynamic gameplay experience.
